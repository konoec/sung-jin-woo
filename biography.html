      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>Sung Jin-Woo is the protagonist of Solo Leveling, a popular web novel and manhwa created by Chugong. Initially, he was known as the <strong>weakest hunter</strong> in South Korea, barely surviving low-rank dungeons as an E-Rank Hunter. However, his fate changed dramatically when he encountered a mysterious <strong>Double Dungeon</strong> that granted him the power of the Systemâ€”an advanced interface that allowed him to level up like a video game character.</p>
      <p>As he grew stronger, Jin-Woo evolved from a struggling hunter into the <strong>Shadow Monarch</strong>, one of the most powerful beings in existence. His journey is filled with intense battles, thrilling adventures, and an unstoppable rise to power.</p>
      <p>With his <strong>limitless growth</strong>, mastery over the <strong>Shadow Army</strong>, and an unbreakable will, Sung Jin-Woo has become a legendary figure in the world of hunters.</p>
